                <li>Scheduled 1:1 Appointments are 15 or 30-minute appointments and must be scheduled at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting time.  These meetings are often the best option when you have a unique or complex question or concern. In some cases, your advisor may ask, suggest, or require you to schedule an appointment if you send an email or come to drop-in 1:1  advising with a question that requires additional time</li>
                <li>Drop-in 1:1 Advising Appointments are offered weekly and do not require pre-registration. Students may be seen by any member of the advising team during a drop-in appointment and are seen on a first-come, first-served basis. Drop-ins are a great option if you have a time-sensitive question that can be addressed in under 10 minutes. </li>
                <li>Email is a great way to connect with our advising team asynchronously, which can be helpful for students managing multiple responsibilities. Email also provides you with a written record of our conversation that you can reference later. Please note that we aim to respond to student emails within 24 business hours (Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM, Monday through Friday excluding holidays), but response times may vary.</li>
