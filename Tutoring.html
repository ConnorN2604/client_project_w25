        <p>Rahat Naseem</p>
        <p>I am here to support you with algebra, statistics, and any math-related questions you have. I am passionate about helping students overcome math anxiety by encouraging a shift from a fixed mindset ("I'm not good at math") to a growth mindset ("I can learn and improve in math"). With my experience in linear algebra, calculus, and a variety of other math topics, I can help you tackle homework, clarify concepts, and prepare for exams. Additionally, I can also assist with SI-425 and SI-370. My goal is to make math more accessible and enjoyable, and I’m excited to help you succeed and reach your academic goals.</p>
